# Contester++

This is our project for the CEN 311 Web Technologies and Programming course, Fall Semester, BSc. in Computer Engineering,
Epoka University.

Contester++ is a web application that servers as an internal judge platform that Epoka teachers can use to
create coding problems, contests, assignments for their courses and where students can solve them. This idea was inspired
by our existing internal judge platform, Contester.
